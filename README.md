# Restaurant Website using HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Customer Website Launched
As part of my just concluded course in 2k23 i developed a *real* website for a *real* client. Below is a link to the final product. (*Note*, the site is left without speed optimization to keep it exactly as it was in the course. Site optimization wasn't part of the course).
